NAME
    Test::Apocalypse - Apocalypse's favorite tests bundled into a simple
    interface

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;

            use Test::More;
            eval { use Test::Apocalypse };
            if ( $@ ) {
                    plan skip_all => 'Test::Apocalypse required for validating the distribution';
            } else {
                    # lousy hack for kwalitee
                    require Test::NoWarnings; require Test::Pod; require Test::Pod::Coverage;
                    is_apocalypse_here();
            }

ABSTRACT
    Using this test module simplifies/bundles common distribution tests
    favored by the CPAN id APOCAL.

DESCRIPTION
    This module greatly simplifies common author tests for modules heading
    towards CPAN. I was sick of copy/pasting the tons of t/foo.t scripts +
    managing them in every distro. I thought it would be nice to bundle all
    of it into one module and toss it on CPAN :) That way, every time I
    update this module all of my dists would be magically updated!

    This module respects the TEST_AUTHOR env variable, if it is not set it
    will skip the entire testsuite. Normally end-users should not run it;
    but you can if you want to see how bad my dists are, ha!

    This module uses Module::Pluggable to have custom "backends" that
    process various tests. We wrap them in a hackish Test::Block block
    per-plugin and it seems to work nicely. If you want to write your own,
    it should be a breeze once you look at some of my plugins and see how it
    works. ( more documentation to come )

  Usage
    In order to use this, you would need to be familiar with the "standard"
    steps in order to fully exercise the testsuite. There are a few steps we
    require, because our plugins need stuff to be prepared for them. For
    starters, you would need a test file in your distribution similar to the
    one in SYNOPSIS. Once that is done and added to your MANIFEST and etc,
    you can do this:

            perl Build.PL                   # sets up the dist ( duh, hah )
            ./Build dist                    # makes the tarball ( so certain plugins can process it )
            TEST_AUTHOR=1 ./Build test      # runs the testsuite!

EXPORT
    Automatically exports the "is_apocalypse_here" sub.

MORE IDEAS
    *   Make sure we have no unnecessary +x files ( especially Build.PL! )

    *   Document the way we do plugins so others can add to this testsuite
        :)

    *   Per-plugin configuration for distros so we can override the default
        config

    *   POD standards check ( do we have SYNOPSIS, ABSTRACT, SUPPORT, etc
        sections? )

SEE ALSO
    None.
